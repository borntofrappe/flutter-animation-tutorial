> instead of instantiating the project from the first lesson I try to recreate the application on my own

## Overview

```text
lib
    models
        Trip.dart
    screens
        details.dart
        home.dart
    shared
        heart.dart
        screenTitle.dart
        tripList.dart

    main.dart
```

`Trip.dart` defines a model to describe the trip with a few fields:

`details.dart` and `home.dart` describe the two routes of the application

The `shared` folder includes reusable widgets.

`main.dart` kickstarts the application.

### Trip


### home


### details


### shared
